# Search the Database

All data the submittor has agreed to publish is searchable for the public. 
The OCDB WebUI offers a search interface. Main feature of that interface is the search text field.
You can enter a single keyword which will attempt to find data using the meta
data fields provided by the submittor. This field also allows to use the
so-called Lucene syntax which enables you to search for specific field values
and also allows chaining.
