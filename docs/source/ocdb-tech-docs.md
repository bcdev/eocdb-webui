# Editing the Documentation

## Step 1: Get a GitHub Account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account for yourself. 
In future you will be able to use your internal BitBucket infrastructure
to do exactly the same.

## Step 2: Click on an md file

Go to the [OCDB docs](https://github.com) and click on an md file. On
the top right corner you find an edit button. Click it and an editor will 
open. 

The editor uses so-called markdown. Markdown documents are great for
these kinds of documents but have two issues: images and tables.

## A brief on Markdown

Markdown is a simple text file that is in this case translated into html.
The translator needs information about formattings like paragraphs, headers,
images etc. This is done by special characters. A hash (#) for instance
tells the translator  that a heading is following. The number of hashes 
you use notifies which level the heading is.

To gie an example:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header2

- list item1
- list item2
  - list item 2.1
```

Translates into:

# Header 1
## Header2

- list item1
- list item2
  - list item 2.1
